# FileWriter
Implemented a Java program (FileReadWriteExample) that demonstrates basic file I/O operations.  

Features:
- Writes sample notes to a file named 'notes.txt' using FileWriter.
- Reads the content of 'notes.txt' line-by-line using FileReader wrapped in BufferedReader.
- Uses try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
- Designed to run directly in VS Code without additional configuration.
- Outputs status messages for both write and read operations.
